### Introduction
<br/>
Hey, I'm Mike Lee and this is my portfolio/blog where I talk about Esports, IT, and Anime.
<br/>
### Education
<br/>
I graduated from Western Washington University with a B.S. in Business Administration with a concentration in Management Information Systems. I also minored in Japanese and am a certified E-Commerce Developer through WWU's Internet Studies Center. As an avid learner, I continue to enroll in MOOCs to expand my horizons so that I can apply that knowledge to my professional career and hobbies.
<br/>
### Esports
<br/>
Although I have always been a part of the gaming community, my passion for Esports grew tenfold in the years that I attended Western Washington University. There I founded the WWU Gaming Association, a registered student organization that serves as a centralized support network for all affiliated university gaming efforts. Prior to WWUGA, my community contributions to the industry were always on a more granular level, whether it be as a spectator, player, contributor, etc. These were all valuable experiences, that when coupled with my formal education and skills, allowed me to succeed in a space no one dared to explore.`
<br/>
<br/>
The Esports industry has a growing need for innovative leaders who can stay ahead of the curve and adapt to this emerging industry's challenges that continue to shift. The effort to inspire bright, young minds to become leaders in the industry, to equip them with the skills and knowledge to succeed like those before them is truly a valiant effort. I aspire to be in a position where I can do the same for others like those who have the done the same for me.
<br/>
### IT
<br/>
As the eldest of my siblings, I was always in charge of learning new technologies so I could teach it to the rest of my family. As someone who enjoys learning and solving problems, IT was a natural fit for me. IT steered my life in a way that I never thought it would, from reading IT magazines from libraries in elementary school, to picking up skills and certifications in high school, to obtaining a degree at WWU revolving around IT, to where I am now in my career. It allowed me to become a source of knowledge for others and that's something that I can feel proud of. 
<br/>
<br/>
These times call for increasingly more skilled and more people in computer literacy overall, with the Age of Information, distributed computing, and the continued trend of seeing computers becoming a more integrated part of living. In the meantime I am keeping up with my pursuit of knowledge in IT through MOOCs and exploring what other opportunities are out there for me to learn.
