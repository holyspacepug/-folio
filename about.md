### Introduction
<br/>
Hey, I'm Mike Lee and this is my website where I talk about Esports, Tech, and Anime.
<br/>
### Education
<br/>
I graduated from Western Washington University with a B.S. in Business Administration with a concentration in Management Information Systems. I also minored in Japanese and am a certified E-Commerce Developer through WWU's Internet Studies Center.
<br/>
### Esports
<br/>
My passion for Esports grew from playing traditional sports and my heavy involvement in community efforts in gaming. During college I had the honor of fouding WWU's Official Gaming Organization [WWUGA], thanks to my experiences and inspiration from colleagues. My only regret was that I couldn't do more in my time at WWUGA. Esports has a growing need of leaders to build strong communities, empowering and creating opportunities for each other. It starts with the industry building from a solid foundation, the **student**. The target in Esports is always moving, to be one of those bright individuals involved in solving those problems would be a once in a lifetime opportunity.
<br/>
### Tech
<br/>
I was always involved in Tech, being the eldest of my siblings, I was always in charge of learning new technologies so I could teach it to them and my parents. I enjoy learning as it goes hand-in-hand with being a problem solver, and with the IT industry being at the forefront of innovation, it's as good as it gets. Having the opportunity to become a source of knowledge for others, to help them find joy in learning new things as well, soon came to be a passion of mine and led to my eventual pursuit of formal IT knowledge through certifications, MOOCs, and college.
