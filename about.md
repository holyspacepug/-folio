### Introduction
<br/>
Hello, I'm Mike Lee and this is my portfolio/blog where I talk about esports, tech, and anime.
<br/>
### Education
<br/>
I graduated from Western Washington University with a B.S. in Business Administration with a concentration on Management Information Systems. I also minored in Japanese and am a certified E-Commerce Developer through WWU. I continue to expand my horizons so I can apply that knowledge to my professional career and hobbies.
<br/>
### Esports
<br/>
My passion for esports grew tenfold during college, where I founded the WWU Gaming Association. Prior to WWUGA my contributions were more granular, but when coupled with my formal education and skills, has allowed me to succeed in a space no one dared to explore.
Esports has a growing need for innovative leaders who can stay ahead of the curve and adapt to continually shifting challenges. Inspiring bright, young minds to become leaders in the industry, to equip them with the skills and knowledge to succeed like those before them is absolutely a necessary effort.
<br/>
### Tech 
<br/>
As someone who enjoys learning and solving problems, IT is a natural fit for me. From reading tech magazines from libraries in elementary school, to where I am now in my career, IT allows me to become a source of knowledge for others and that's something that I'm proud of.
With the continuing trend of computers becoming more a integrated part of living, newer heights of computer literacy becomes necessary. In the meantime I'm keeping up with my pursuit of knowledge in tech through MOOCs and exploring what other opportunities are there for me to learn.
<br/>
### Anime
<br/>
Anime has always been a huge part of my life and without it I wouldn't be the person I am today. I've cosplayed for anime companies, put together events, and done various other works in the anime industry circuit. The effort that creators put into their work deserve to appreciated more; I genuinely feel that anime has given so much to me, that I'm always looking for ways to give back and build it up.
